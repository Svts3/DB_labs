- Create a database (DB).
- In this database, create a scheme with a name that corresponds to the student's last name. All newly created objects must belong to this schema.
- Build all necessary objects (tables, primary keys, secondary keys, external keys, indexes, check constraints) for the specified database.
- Enter at least 10 abstract records in each database table (if the number of course not limited to logic).
- Create a diagram for a fully designed database. Tables should be displayed on chart in standard mode (columnname, datatype, allow null) Relationships between adjust the tables in such a way as to indicate between which columns they are establish a connection. Designation: P.K. – primary key; U.I. – unique index; I. – non-unique index; CHECK is a check constraint.

Create a relational database schema that allows you to store data
about the owner of the smart watch, the location of the watch (gps
coordinates), charge of the watch, heartbeat of the owner of the watch
(information is sent every minute)). One owner can have
several clocks, or several clocks may be
registered to one owner and used by others
by people: for example, a grandson bought a smart watch for his grandmother. For
every smart watch can be customized
home address, and a list of telephone numbers to which he should come
notification in case of serious changes in the smart watch readings
(for example - a sharp increase in heart rate)
